# holaIO Server
Apart from releasing the code for our different libraries, we're also releasing our server code so all of you can know what's happening there. And this is Free Software, it's there for you to improve on it so that we can all innovate together.

holaIO is built so that you can use web content in your apps very easily thanks to our Android, iOS and Javascript libraries. Apart from library specific funciontalities like caching, the main work is done in our servers with the code you can find here.
